Test Guideline

This will be the second part of your test at Punch before we get you started on a particular project; this is to analyse your skill levels and problem solving skills. Your future at Punch will be dependant on the outcome of this test, so make sure to give it your all!

The codebase you will all be working on is a chrome extension, primary goal of the system is go grow your social media accounts in a similar fashion as a human; in order to avoid getting caught or raising any flags.

Your aim is to:
* 		Implement MVC architecture (Re-architect)
* 		Introduce class base structure (Master class and sub class structure (Inheritance))
* 		DRY Principle (Don't repeat yourself)
* 		Refactor the codebase  (Improving legacy functions & removing code redundancy)

You will have 5 working days to highlight the direction and progress.

Daily sync up calls are already scheduled in your calendars; each individual will join in daily to share their progress on the call on what was accomplished in the last 24 hours and what the next direction is. This call will primarily be used for catchup and feedback purposes.

For application installation, a read me file is included on Github.

The repo access has been shared; you all have a branch allocated to you by your name in which you should be working on; please make sure not to commit in the main/master.

NOTE: 
THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL TASK; COLLABORATIONS CAN LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION.
YOU SHOULD ALL LOG YOUR HOURS IN HUBSTAFF CORRECTLY, THATS TAKEN IN RESPECT WHILE CONCLUDING THE TEST RESULTS
